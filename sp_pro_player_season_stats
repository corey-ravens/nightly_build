	Create a table so taht you can pull games from the previous season during early weeks.  It is hard to have enough snaps to hit the minimum thresholds early in the season,
	so find the player's most recent # games to pull stats from.  But only go back one year, so if for example he was on IR all last year, you don't go back two years for #
	most recent games.  

	This variable will always be a rolling last # game count, so once we get # games into this season, it's based on his last # games this season.

	Because joining to this while counting the stats takes a long time, create temp versions of the offensive and defensive alignment tables now that you can join to in
	the stat summing steps.

	Blocking Stats (as of 10/2017)

	1)  Disruptions Allowed Rate - disruptions allowed / pass blocking snaps
		1a)  Adjusted Disruptions (count sacks more than hurries, etc. - the year to year correlation was much lower than unadjusted disruptions)
	2)  Run Blocking Wins - run block plays with positive PFF grade / run blocking snaps
		2a)  Pulling "Successes" - same as above, but on plays when pulling *****there aren't really enough opportunities for this to be viable yet
	3)  Running Yards Created - yards before contact (adjusted by PFF grade) / run blocking snaps 
		****this one is close to Run successes in terms of year to year correlation, but I worry is it's basically just giving PFF grade for players,
		just on different scale)
	4)  Pre Snap Penaltes per play
		4a) Mental Error Penalties per play (false start, unsportsmanlike, unneccessary roughness)

	Run Defense Stats (as of 10/2017)

	This program is for calculating Run Defense Stats.

	1)	Run Defense Wins
	
	X)  Rush Yards Against - 
		The stat is still a little too heavily influenced by teammates but by incoporating the 
		grade and double team yard adjustement helps with some of that.  We explored including
		team rushing yards allowed with and without the player but it didn't make any significant
		improvements, and had odd looking coefficients. This one was ended in 10/2017 because of
		how much teammate influence there was. We switched to run defense wins because it was more
		individual and more consistent year to year.

	Coverage Stats (as of 02/2017)

	This program is for calculating Coverage Stats.

	1)  PBU %:  # of PBUs / # of Targets

	2)  Yards Per Attempt Against:  # of Passing Yards Allowed when Targeted / Number of Coverage Snaps
		XXXX REMOVED) Completion % Against:  # of Completions (including Drops) Allowed / Number of Coverage Snaps (But reverse this one for the regression)

	3)  YAC Against:  Number of Plays where you allowed less YAC than Expected (and didn't allow a TD or get a penalty, incompletion counts as less then expected) / YAC Opportunities
		XXXX REMOVED) YAC Against:  (Actual YAC Against - Expected YAC Against) / Targets

	4) Interception %:  # of INTs / # of PBUs
		**Think of PBU% like OBP - of your chances at the plate (targeted), how many times do you get on base (get a PBU)
		**Then INT% is like SLUG - when you do get on base (PBU), how many bases do you get (INTs)

	Interceptions do not result in the pass_break_up field getting a 1 as well, so make sure to sum up PBUs and INTs to get
	total PBUs.

	Until PFF goes back and fills in some of the important fields (i.e. middle of field open / closed) we can only track these from 2012 and later.

	Receiving Stats

	As of (09/2017) the stats ARE:

	1)  Catch % = catches / targets (excluding penalties)
		**Drop rate (drops / (catches + drops), catches/catchable targets, and catches/expected catches were all very inconsistent year to year.
	2)  Yards After Catch = yards after catch / receptions
	3)  Yards per Route Run = (receiving yards + penalty yards drawn) / routes run


	As of (07/2017) the stats WERE:

	1)  Catch % = catches / catchable targets (excluding penalties)
		1b) Extra catches = catches / sum of catch probability on catchable targets (accounts for deeper passes being less likely to be completed)
	2)  Yards per Target = (receiving yards + penalty yards drawn) / catchable targets
		2b)  Adjusted Net Yards Per Attempt When Targeted or QB Rating when targeted
	3)  Yards per Route Run = (receiving yards + penalty yards drawn) / routes run
		3b)  Receptions per route run (if using AYA / Target for previous one)

	AY/A - adjusted yards per passing attempt: (pass yards + 20*(pass TD) - 45*(interceptions thrown))/(passing attempts). This stat was introduced, and the reasoning behind it thoroughly explained in a book called The Hidden Game of Football, by Bob Carroll, Pete Palmer, and John Thorn. Note that we are now using 20 yards per TD instead of 10, because of research by Chase Stuart at the p-f-r blog.
